🍦 ruCream is a light mode, minimalistic, cream colored theme for vscode JavaScript applications and is heavily inspired by the [Ayu][] color themes. The base template of ruCream is a modification of the [Ayu Light][] theme's color choices while maintaining it's key concepts.

Designed as a light creamy theme, inspired by the iconic Russian cream dessert color palette, consisting of reds, creams, whites, and the signature glass or white bowl, which gives a sleek, minimalistic, and even delicious feeling to the code. We'd suggest using the [Azeret Mono][] font with a size of 11px, as shown in our screenshots below, for a more delicious experience.

    Ingredients:
        - 1 envelope unflavored gelatin 🍮
        - 1/2 cup cold water 💧
        - 1 cup heavy whipping cream 🍦
        - 3/4 cup sugar 🍬
        - 1 cup sour cream 🥛
        - 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 🥄
        - 1 package (10 ounces) frozen sweetened raspberries, thawed 🍓
        - Fresh raspberries and mint sprigs, optional 🌿
